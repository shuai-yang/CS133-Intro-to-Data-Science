It is true that the probability distribution of a statistic contains more accurate information about the statistic than an empirical distribution does. 
But often, as in this example, the approximation provided by the empirical distribution is sufficient for data scientists to understand how much a statistic can vary. 
And empirical distributions are easier to compute, if you have a computer. Therefore, data scientists often use empirical distributions 
instead of exact probability distributions when they are trying to understand the properties of a statistic.

Notice that unlike the largest number observed, the new estimate ("twice the average") can overestimate the number of planes.
This will happen when the average of the observed serial numbers is closer to  N  than to 1.

You can see that the old method almost always underestimates; formally, we say that it is biased. But it has low variability, 
and is highly likely to be close to the true total number of planes.
The new method overestimates about as often as it underestimates, and thus is roughly unbiased on average in the long run. 
However, it is more variable than the old estimate, and thus is prone to larger absolute errors.
